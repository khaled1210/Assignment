### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

result_subtraction = 10 - 4
print(result_subtraction)  # Output: 6
# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
result = (3 * 4) + 5
print(result)  # Expected Output: 17
# This will convert 120 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
minutes = 120
hours = minutes / 60
print(hours)  # Expected Output: 2.0
**Objectives:**

- List popular languages for Data Science.
- Introduce common libraries used in Data Science.
- Present a table of Data Science tools.
- Provide examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.
- Demonstrate converting minutes to hours using Python.
